## Introduction 🌟

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding thread synchronization, its importance, and the issues that arise in multi-threaded programs when thread synchronization techniques are not employed.

## Why is Thread Synchronization Needed? ❓

Thread synchronization is essential in multi-threaded programs where multiple threads compete to perform conflicting operations on a shared resource. Without synchronization, the program can exhibit undefined behavior, data inconsistencies, or even crash.

## Conflicting Operations ⚔️

- Read-Write Operations
- Write-Write Operations

Not Conflicting:
- Read-Read Operations

## Example: Linked List Operations 🔗

Consider a multi-threaded process `P` with threads `T1` and `T2`. Both threads operate on a shared linked list of integers. 
- `T1` executes a function `get_node_from_list()` to find a node in the linked list based on an integer value.
- `T2` executes a function `delete_node_from_list()` to remove a node from the list and free its memory.

## What Could Go Wrong 💥

If both threads are allowed to execute without synchronization:
1. `T1` partially completes its read operation.
2. Context-switching occurs, and `T2` completes its write operation, freeing up memory.
3. `T1` resumes and attempts to access freed memory, causing a crash or undefined behavior.

## Critical Sections 🚫

Areas in the code where shared data is accessed by multiple threads are called "Critical Sections". It's crucial to synchronize access to these sections to prevent data inconsistencies or crashes.

## Interview Questions 🎤

### What are conflicting operations in thread synchronization?
  
  **Answer**: Conflicting operations are Read-Write or Write-Write operations on a shared resource. These operations can cause data inconsistencies or crashes if not synchronized properly.

### Why can't you assume any determinism or pattern of scheduling of threads?

  **Answer**: The operating system schedules threads based on its internal algorithm. Making assumptions about thread scheduling can lead to unexpected behavior, making it crucial to employ thread synchronization techniques.

### What is a critical section, and why is it important?

  **Answer**: A critical section is a piece of code where a shared resource is accessed by multiple threads. It's vital to synchronize access to critical sections to maintain data consistency and prevent crashes.

## Summary 📝

Thread synchronization is essential for maintaining data consistency and avoiding undefined behaviors in multi-threaded programs. By understanding and properly implementing synchronization techniques, you can ensure the stable and reliable operation of your multi-threaded applications.

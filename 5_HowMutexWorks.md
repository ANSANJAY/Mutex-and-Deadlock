### Interview Revision Notes on How Mutexes Work 🛠️

#### Goal of Mutexes 🎯
- **Sole Purpose**: To grant access to the critical section to only one thread at a time.

#### Declaring Mutexes in POSIX 📚
- **Data Type**: `pthread_mutex_t` is a data type provided by the POSIX standard to declare and define mutex objects.

#### Usage in Program Example 🖥
- **Scenario**: Three concurrent threads (T1, T2, T3) are executing inside a function called `foo` which contains a critical section.
- **Without Mutex**: All threads would access the critical section concurrently, causing problems.
- **With Mutex**: Mutual exclusivity is provided to the threads regarding the critical section.

#### Mutex Lock and Unlock API Calls 🔒🔓
- **Locking the Mutex**: Use `pthread_mutex_lock` to lock the mutex and gain ownership.
- **Unlocking the Mutex**: Use `pthread_mutex_unlock` to release the mutex after exiting the critical section.

#### Mutex Ownership 🗝
- **Thread Ownership**: Whichever thread locks the mutex first becomes its owner and can enter the critical section.
- **Blocking Other Threads**: Any other threads trying to lock an already locked mutex will get blocked.

#### Thread Scheduling 🔄
- **Granting Mutex**: Among multiple threads waiting for the mutex, only one will be granted it based on factors like thread priority or OS scheduling policy.

#### Mutex Deadlock Scenario ☠️
- A thread must **not** intentionally terminate while holding a mutex lock; otherwise, a deadlock situation can occur.

#### Performance Considerations 🚀
- **Blocking/Unblocking Overheads**: Frequent blocking and unblocking cause scheduling work overheads, leading to poorer application performance.
- **Critical Section Size**: Larger the size of the critical section, the longer the threads will have to wait, affecting performance negatively.

### Interview Questions and Answers 🎙

#### Q1: What is the primary goal of using Mutexes? 🎯
> **Answer**: The primary goal of using Mutexes is to ensure that only one thread can access a critical section at any given time, thereby achieving mutual exclusivity.

#### Q2: How is a Mutex declared in POSIX-based systems? 📚
> **Answer**: In POSIX-based systems, a Mutex is declared using the `pthread_mutex_t` data type. This data type allows you to define and initialize mutex objects.

#### Q3: Describe the process of locking and unlocking a Mutex. 🔒🔓
> **Answer**: A Mutex is locked using the `pthread_mutex_lock` API call, making the calling thread the owner of the Mutex. The Mutex should be unlocked using the `pthread_mutex_unlock` API call when the thread exits the critical section.

#### Q4: What happens to other threads when a Mutex is already locked? 🚫
> **Answer**: When a Mutex is already locked, any other threads attempting to lock it will get blocked until the Mutex is released by its current owner.

#### Q5: What factors can influence which blocked thread gets the Mutex next? 🔄
> **Answer**: The next thread to receive the Mutex can depend on various factors, such as thread priority or the operating system's scheduling policy.

#### Q6: Can a thread terminate while holding a Mutex? What are the consequences? ☠️
> **Answer**: A thread should not terminate while holding a Mutex as it would lead to a deadlock situation. Other threads waiting for that Mutex will be blocked indefinitely.

#### Q7: How does the size of the critical section affect application performance? 🚀
> **Answer**: A larger critical section increases the time threads must wait to access it, potentially degrading application performance.

#### Q8: What impact does frequent blocking and unblocking of threads have on application performance? 🛑🟢
> **Answer**: Frequent blocking and unblocking of threads can introduce considerable scheduling overhead for the operating system, leading to poorer application performance.

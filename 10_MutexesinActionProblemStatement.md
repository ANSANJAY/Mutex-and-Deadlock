## Objective 🎯
- Achieve mutual exclusion between two threads accessing a shared data structure, such as an array.
- Ensure that only one thread can act on the shared data structure at a time.

---

## Global Mutex 🌍
- Declare a global mutex variable to protect against unsafe concurrent thread access to the global data structure.

---

## Mutex Initialization 🛠
- Initialize the mutex in the main function when your application starts.
- Once initialized, the mutex is ready to be used for implementing mutual exclusion.

---

## Mutex in Action: Swap and Sum 🔄🔢
### Swap Function
- A thread callback function called `Swap`.
- This function swaps the first and last elements of the array.
- Use mutex lock and unlock to sandwich the swap logic, ensuring mutual exclusion.

### Sum Function
- Another thread callback function called `Sum`.
- This function calculates the sum of the elements of the array.
- Again, use mutex lock and unlock to sandwich the logic, ensuring only one thread acts at a time.

---

## The Importance of Code Locking 🔐
- The use of mutexes in the `Swap` and `Sum` functions ensures that if one thread is in the middle of executing its logic, the other will have to wait.
- This is known as "Code Locking."
- For example, if thread T1 is computing the sum and locks the mutex, another thread T2 will block if it tries to swap elements.
- This guarantees that the output of the program will always be consistent, e.g., the sum as 15 in the example.

---

## Key Takeaways 📚
- Mutexes are crucial for ensuring mutual exclusion in multithreaded programs.
- Initialization is necessary before using a mutex.
- The logic for read and write operations on shared data structures should be sandwiched between mutex lock and unlock calls.

## Interview Questions 🤔

### Q1: How do you initialize a mutex in a C program?
👉 **Answer**: 
You can initialize a mutex by calling the `pthread_mutex_init` function, usually in the main function of your application or process.

### Q2: What is the concept of "Code Locking"?
👉 **Answer**: 
Code locking involves using a mutex to lock a segment of code so that only one thread can execute it at a time. This prevents data races and ensures consistent output.

### Q3: How do you ensure that multiple threads don't conflict when accessing a shared resource?
👉 **Answer**: 
You can use a mutex to lock the segment of code that accesses the shared resource, thus ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.

### Q4: In what scenarios is using a global mutex beneficial?
👉 **Answer**: 
A global mutex is useful when you have a global data structure that multiple threads need to access safely. By locking and unlocking this global mutex, you can ensure that only one thread at a time can manipulate the data structure, thus ensuring data integrity.

### Q5: Why is mutual exclusion important in multithreaded programming?
👉 **Answer**: 
Mutual exclusion is crucial for data integrity and consistency. It ensures that operations on shared data structures are atomic, preventing data races and leading to predictable and correct output.
